\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This project aimed to create a rock climbing video game in which the player
climbs a virtual wall by making motions in the real world, and it achieved its
goal. The player is able to reach up, down, left, and right in reality in order
to find and grasp virtual handholds. If the player lets go of all handholds,
they fall back to the beginning. When the player reaches the top of the wall,
the game is over and the movement stops until reset. The users primary input to
the game is a set of colored gloves, equipped with haptic feedback motors, and
flex sensors. Each glove is separately colored to enable hand tracking by a
video camera. The flex sensors on the glove are used to sense when the player
makes a physical grabbing motion that is then replicated in the game. A force
feedback system was designed and implemented, however it caused a drop in power
supply voltage, making the flex sensors unreliable when the motors vibrate.
Because the motors were used to indicate that a hold could be grabbed, it was
considered too large of a drawback, and not enabled in the final design.
Additionally, the stretch goal of including a map editor was partially
implemented, however movement within the editor causes glitches.
