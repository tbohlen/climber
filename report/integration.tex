\section{Integration}
\label{sec:integration}

While integrating the two major modules was initially frustrating, it did not
prove to be as difficult as once thought. The only information passed between
each module is the x and y positions of each hand. Because this information is
updated only once a frame (which is very infrequent compared to the clock),
setup and hold times were very lenient, and clock skew between the two could
essentially be ignored. One integration issue that did come up was concerning
the output to the VGA display. Each major module has their own VGA output, which
then multiplexed. The tracking module has the calibration display, and the
gameplay module displays the game. The outputs of both of these were not in sync
with each other, as there was a long propagation delay through the gameplay
module after already passing through the tracking module. Initially, when the
output multiplexer selected which sets of signals to display, it used
non-blocking assignments dictated by the tracking blocks clock, which did not
meet the setup a holds times of the gameplay block. This initially aroused
suspicion of a much larger clocking issue, but after switching the multiplexer
to blocking assignments, the issue was fixed.
