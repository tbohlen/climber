\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This project aims to create a rock climbing video game in which the player can
climb a virtual wall by making motions in the real world. The player will be
able to reach up, down, left, and right in reality in order to find and grasp
the virtual handholds. A force feedback system will provide tactile information
about the location of holds, and a computer display will provide visual cues. If
the player lets go, they will fall back to the beginning. The game is over when
the player reaches the top of the virtual wall.

Hand tracking will be achieved using two colored gloves, one for each hand, and
a video camera.  Force feedback will be provided by one or more small vibrating
motors. Finally, a button placed on the glove will register when the player has
grabbed a virtual hold.

Stretch goals include creating a three dimensional environment, a map editor, and adding head
tracking in order to create a virtual headlamp that allows the user to only see
a small number of holds at a time.
