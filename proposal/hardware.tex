\section{Hardware}

This system requires a significant amount of additional hardware.

First, two gloves are required to allow for hand tracking and tactile feedback.
Two colored gloves will be borrowed from the 6.111 lab supply, one red and one
green.

Second, a number of vibration motors will be purchased. The 6.111 staff
has confirmed that the cost of these components will be reimbursed. The
following model sold by Adafruit seems workable: \\

Third, two push-buttons will also be used. These will be borrowed from the 6.111
supply. We still need to confirm that these are available.

Forth, and finally, one video camera will be used to gather position information
from the real world and insert it into the game world. This will be borrowed
from the 6.111 lab supply.

If possible, a virtual headlamp will be added to the game, allowing the user to
tilt their head in order to see different portions of the wall in front of them.
The entire wall will never be visible. To accomplish this stretch goal, a
styrofoam ball will be purchased online and painted blue to provide a trackable
color mass.

Turner Bohlen will construct the hardware components of this system. Parts
should be received by November 15, 2013 and construction of the first version of
the hardware system should be completed by November 22, 2013. Additional
modifications may be necessary after this date.
