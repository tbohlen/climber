This project will be a 2D virtual reality rock climbing game. The player will wear two gloves, each with grab buttons and a haptic feedback system, to be tracked by a camera. The position of the players hands will be overlaid onscreen, allowing the player to climb a virtual wall. The game will be broken into two main blocks, in addition to the glove block, which simply controls feedback and the grab button. The first block is the tracking module. It will take in video information from a camera, store it in memory, then find the center of mass of both hands for every frame. It will then send this to a position module, which will be used to smooth out the hand position movement before sending it to the gameplay module. The gameplay module will take the hand position, to create and send video information to the VGA output in the labkit. It will do this with four submodules. The handhold submodule will keep track of the handholds on the map, the grab submodule will see if a player is grabbing a handhold, the movement submodule will control the position of the camera, and the pixel information submodule will output video information. Finally, a glove block will control the haptic feedback system, as well send information from the grab button to the gameplay module. When all three major modules are interfaced, the game will be ready to play.
