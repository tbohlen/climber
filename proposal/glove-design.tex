\section{Glove Block Design}

The glove block will manage inputs from and outputs to the two gloves the player
wears while using the game. Two modules comprise the entire block.

debouncing of button input and the other for processing of tactile feedback duty
cycles.}

\subsection{Tactile Feedback}

The tactile feedback module takes as input a short sequence of bits from the
gameplay block and outputs two signals to the gloves, one for each vibration
motor. The complexity of this system is minimal. It will use a divider and a
couple counting registers in order to control the duty cycles of the two motors.

A stretch goal would be do add additional vibration motors to provide more
complex tactile feedback. This would require a simple expansion of the inputs
and outputs of this module, allowing for the use of more complex information
about the placement of hands and objects on screen.

\subsection{Debounce}

The debounce module will take the raw output of two buttons from the gloves and
prevent dirty or asynchronous input. The 6.111-provided debounce module will be
used.
